# -WhenAreWeGoingToDoTheThingsWeAreThinkingAboutNowAndSinceApril2017-

my blank face at times and some of my non-responses were bc i didnt want u to get in trouble

bc what i was thinking was "i get u, i get it, not here, not now, ur going to get in trouble for this"

so i was the original non-responder, y'all just copied mee

then i sort of forgot about everything after i left

then when my dad picked me up from the bus stop (i dunno why i didnt drive that morning i dunno) he asked how the interview was and i said "this guy was talking non stop for an hr and he was smarter than those penn people i was around" so i didnt remember anything by that time and i was just like, i need to figure out what im doing with my life like where am i going to move bc i was interviewing in ny/philly/boston

but now im like what were you thinking lol

my thoughts were like extremely R-rated, i dunno why or how that happened they just were, thats just what was happening its so funny lol

i remember thinking when i was leaving that u were gonna miss me when i was gone lol

bc when i was at penn, i had a coworker i was bffs with and i would not take days off bc she would miss me the entire day lol she would be like "i walked around campus for lunch and i had no one to talk to" and i was like ohh sht i feel bad for taking a day off now
