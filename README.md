# -WhenAreWeGoingToDoTheThingsWeAreThinkingAboutNowAndSinceApril2017-

my blank face at times and some of my non-responses were bc i didnt want u to get in trouble

bc what i was thinking was "i get u, i get it, not here, not now, ur going to get in trouble for this"

so i was the original non-responder, y'all just copied mee

then i sort of forgot about everything after i left

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8sFE8_usN0 thats what i was thinking ... that specific voice was in my head (im a huge futurama fan) lol

then when my dad picked me up from the bus stop (i dunno why i didnt drive that morning i dunno) he asked how the interview was and i said "this guy was talking non stop for an hr and he was smarter than those penn people (potdocs/profs) i was around" so i didnt remember anything by that time and i was just like, i need to figure out what im doing with my life like where am i going to move bc i was interviewing in ny/philly/boston

[but now im like what were you thinking lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dwzk-XZxZ4k)

my thoughts were like extremely X-rated, i dunno why or how that happened they just were, thats just what was happening its so funny lol

i remember thinking when i was leaving that u were gonna miss me when i was gone lol

bc when i was at penn, i had a coworker i was bffs with and i would not take days off bc she would miss me the entire day lol she would be like "i walked around campus for lunch and i had no one to talk to" and i was like ohh sht i feel bad for taking a day off now

but u were different on the phone when i called u in 2018, there were all these erie long pauses where u didnt say anything and i was like huh what happened, a little moody, and u sounded so sad when u were like "you should be here" and i didnt inquire further bc i was like, well why am i not then like what happened but i didnt ask what happened

i rememember thinking about the long pauses, they were like __hauntingly erie__, like i was worried about you, i swear i was obsessed with figuring out what those long pauses were on the phone where u didnt say anything they seemed so unnatural, i was like whats going on with u is everything ok u werent like this before

afterwards, those haunting erie long pauses on the phone from u, were like staring at the color black or like being in the wilderness on like a dark and cold moon-less night, i could feel it there was something off, i still rememember, i was obsessed with figuring out what that was ... i remember the good stuff, but im telling u something was getting me obsessed with the long pauses on the phone

i was watching this multiepisode mark twain documentary the week i first called u

i mentioned this before but i kept the iphone i used to call u lol i dunno why!! i was like i cant mail it back after i got the newer one, and this was 2 iphones ago, i still have it lol
