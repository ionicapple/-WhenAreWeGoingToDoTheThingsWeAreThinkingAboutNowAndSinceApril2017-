# -WhenAreWeGoingToDoTheThingsWeAreThinkingAboutNowAndSinceApril2017-

my blank face at times and some of my non-responses were bc i didnt want u to get in trouble

bc what i was thinking was "i get u, i get it, not here, not now, ur going to get in trouble for this"

so i was the original non-responder, y'all just copied mee

then i sort of forgot about everything after i left

then when my dad picked me up from the bus stop (i dunno why i didnt drive that morning i dunno) he asked how the interview was and i said "this guy was talking non stop for an hr and he was smarter than those penn people i was around" so i didnt remember anything by that time and i was just like, i need to figure out what im doing with my life like where am i going to move bc i was interviewing in ny/philly/boston

but now im like what were you thinking lol
